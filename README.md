# PAWSibilities
 
PAWSibilities is an Arduino library designed to operate the Nybble board, which was developed under the OpenCat project. Please see their original code at [PetoiCamp](https://github.com/PetoiCamp/OpenCat). The code contained in this repository relies heavily on the original design.

This code is **very** much still in active development. It is close to ready for its first release, but there are multiple issues that still need to be resolved.
